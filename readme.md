A capstone project for data entry automation using Beautiful Soup, Selenium Webdriver, and Object
Oriented Programming.

Using beautiful soup, property listings were scraped from the zillow website to get their addresses,
prices, and links to the listings. The lists were combined into one using `zip()` function and were
passed as data to google form for input.

Using selenium webdriver, the above data were inputted one by one to the address, price, and link fields
of the Ggoogle form link. An Excel file can be created out of the responses.
